# twittersentiment
In this paper I will try to predict the sentiment of the users when they write a tweet about their experience when flying with different US airlines. The dataset is publicly available at
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/crowdflower/twitter-airline- sentiment.

The dataset already has a classification using positive, negative, and neutral for the users’ opinions. I will use different classification models, namely Multinomial Naïve Bayes, K Nearest Neighbours, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machines classifiers to predict the opinions and I will measure the accuracy of each of them. I will analyse the role of accuracy among the classifiers. If accuracy cannot be taken as an absolute measure, I would have to find another way to measure the classifiers. Finally, I will conduct a cost analysis for Logistic Regression.
